Thesis Title	Towards an Affordable Life Logging Device and Open Data Platform Version 2
ABSTRACT
     Towards an Affordable Life Logging Device and Open Data Platform Version 2 is a project that presents the development of the second version of a lifelogging device and its corresponding data platform. It builds upon the first version, which was designed to capture images and environmental data from the user's surroundings and send them directly to a cloud platform for processing. The collected data was used to support a memory recording and retrieval system. However, this approach raised concerns about privacy, as all data was transmitted and processed outside the users control.
     The second version aims to enhance user control over personal data and reduce the risk of privacy violations. The system applies the concept of edge computing to process captured images before sending them to the cloud. This allows the system to protect user privacy while still enabling meaningful use of the stored data.
     The updated lifelogging device continuously captures images and works in conjunction with a smartphone, which acts as an edge device. The smartphone receives images from the device, detects human faces in the photos, and blurs them to protect the privacy of individuals appearing in the images. Facial recognition is also used to compare captured images with registered user photos. For images that match, annotations are added to support future memory retrieval. Only the processed images are uploaded to the cloud platform.
     The system was tested in predefined use-case scenarios to evaluate its basic functionality and performance. The results show that the device performs as intended. Additionally, the developer created automated scripts to support future development and integration of the system.
